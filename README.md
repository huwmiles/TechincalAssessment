# Data Engineering Technical Assessment

Calculate the maximum number of videos plays that were playing concurrently from a given JSON file. 

## Assumptions

- All end times are after their corresponding start time.
- Each play lasts at most a few hours.
- All of the plays happen within one calendar month.

## Test Data Generator 

This project also includes capability to generate sample data in the form of a JSON file which has the option to choose the sample size and range of dates. This allowed the efficiency of the project to be tested with large datasets.
